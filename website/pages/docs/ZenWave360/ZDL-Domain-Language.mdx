# ZDL Domain Modeling Language
ZDL is a domain specific language (DSL) for modeling Event-Driven microservices.

<Quote>
    Among all approaches to software development, Domain-Driven Design is the only one that focused on language as the key tool for a deep understanding of a given domain’s complexity.
    <QuoteAuthor>- Alberto Brandolini in Event Storming</QuoteAuthor>
</Quote>

Inspired by JHipster JDL, ZDL is a language for describing DDD Bounded Contexts, including domain entities and their relationships, services, commands, events and business policies... for Event-Driven Architectures.

It's designed to be compact, readable and expressive. Business friendly, developer friendly, and machine friendly.

ZDL works well as an Ubiquitous Language format.

## File Structure

ZDL files follow a structured format with two main sections:

### File Types and Extensions

ZenWave supports two file types for different purposes:

- **`.zw` files** - Plugin configuration files that can be executed directly from IntelliJ using the play button in the gutter
- **`.zdl` files** - Domain model files that can include both model-related configuration and domain definitions

### 1. Prolog Section (Optional)
Contains metadata and configuration used by ZenWave tooling:
- **`global javadoc`** - File-level documentation
- **`config`** - Plugin configuration and generation settings (for `.zw` files) or model-related configuration (for `.zdl` files)
- **`apis`** - API definitions (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI references)

### 2. Domain Definition Section
Contains the actual domain model declarations:
- **`entities`** - Domain entities and aggregates
- **`enums`** - Enumeration types
- **`services`** - Business operations and commands
- **`inputs/outputs`** - Data transfer objects
- **`events`** - Domain events
- **`policies`** - Business rules and policies

### Structure Rules
- Files can be split into plugin configuration (`.zw`) and model configuration (`.zdl`)
- Prolog elements (`global javadoc`, `config`, `apis`) must appear at the top if present
- Domain elements can be declared in any order and quantity
- All prolog elements are optional

### Syntax Pattern
```
[<global javadoc>]
[<config>]
[<apis>]

[<entity> | <enum> | <aggregate> | <policies> | <service> | <input> | <output> | <event>]*
```

## Entities and Aggregates

Entities describe your domain model and form the core of your Bounded Context. They can be grouped into aggregates using either the `@aggregate` annotation on the aggregate root (recommended) or by defining rich domain aggregates with command handlers and domain events using `aggregate` objects.

Entity declaration syntax:

```
[<entity javadoc>]
[<entity annotation>*]
entity <entity name> [(<table name>)] {
  [<field javadoc>]
  [<field annotation>*]
  <field name> <field type> [<validation>*] [<field suffix javadoc>] [,]
}
```

ZDL entities are compatible with [JHipster JDL entities](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/entities-fields) with additional extensions:
- Annotations with values: single/double-quoted strings, numbers, booleans, and JSON objects
- Nested entities directly on fields
- Field types that can reference other entities or custom types
- Arrays as field types

### Annotations

Annotations are decorators that add metadata to entities, similar to Java or TypeScript. They are optional and can be applied to entities, enums, fields, relationships, services, commands, and events.

Supported parameter types: keywords, strings (single/double quoted), numbers, booleans, and JSON objects.

```zdl
@aggregate
@extends(BaseEntity)
entity ParkingLot {

}
```

SDK plugins interpret certain annotations for code generation:
- `@extends` - Java class extension
- `@copy` - Copy fields without inheritance

### Fields

```zdl
entity A {
  /** the name field */
  name String required unique

  age Integer min(16) /** the age field */

  /**
   * the favorite meal field
   */
  favoriteMeal String maxlength(255)

  anotherField String

  stringWithValue String = "initial value" required

  enumTypeWithValue MyEnum = "MyEnum.VALUE1"
}
```

#### Field Types and Validations

**Supported field types:**
- Primitives: `String`, `Integer`, `Long`, `int`, `long`, `BigDecimal`, `Float`, `float`, `Double`, `double`, `Boolean`, `boolean`
- Date/Time: `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant`, `Duration`
- Binary: `byte`, `byte[]`, `Blob`, `AnyBlob`, `ImageBlob`, `TextBlob`
- Other: `UUID`, `Enum`
- Custom: Any other entity, enum, or custom type

**Available validations:**
- `required`, `unique`
- `min(value)`, `max(value)`
- `minlength(value)`, `maxlength(value)`
- `pattern(/expression/)`

### Documentation Comments

ZDL supports standard comment styles:

- `// line comment (ignored)`
- `/* block comment (ignored) */`
- `/** documentation comment (preserved) */`

Fields support inline suffix documentation: `fieldName Type /** inline docs */`

### Relationships

Relationships are mostly compatible with [JDL Relationships](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/relationships) with some differences:

- ZDL does not support `display field` or `with builtInEntity`
- Options are more flexible and can be any valid annotation name/value pair

**Supported relationship types:** `OneToOne`, `OneToMany`, `ManyToOne`, and `ManyToMany`

**Syntax:**
```
relationship (OneToMany | ManyToOne | OneToOne | ManyToMany) {
  [<from relationship javadoc>]
  [<from relationship annotation>*]
  <from entity>[{<relationship field name> [required]}] to
  [<to relationship javadoc>]
  [<to relationship annotation>*] <to entity>[{<relationship field name> [required]}]
}
```

Relationships can be grouped under the same `relationship` keyword or declared separately:

```zdl
relationship ManyToMany {
  EntityA{fieldPointingB} to EntityB{fieldPointingToA}
  EntityC{fieldPointingD required maxlength(10)} to EntityD{fieldPointingToC}
}

relationship OneToOne {
  EntityParent{fieldPointingChild} to @MapsId EntityChild{fieldPointingToParent}
}
```

ZenWave SDK follows DDD rules for aggregates, cascading persistence from aggregate root to dependent entities and generating unit tests to validate these cascades work as expected.

#### Relationships Between Aggregates

From a DDD perspective, aggregates should be self-contained units of consistency. Relationships between aggregates should typically be modeled by reference/id rather than rich object relationships.

However, modeling relationships by id alone loses information about the relationship being modeled. ZenWave SDK supports modeling rich relationships between aggregates while still generating code that uses reference/id for the actual relationship, plus a read-only rich relationship object for accessing the related aggregate.

This option should be explicitly activated by using `addRelationshipsById` when using `BackendApplicationDefaultPlugin`.

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer {
  name String required
}

@aggregate
entity CustomerOrder {
    orderDate ZonedDateTime required
    /* customerId Integer */ // modeling by id loses relationship information
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  // This generates both CustomerOrder.[get/set]CustomerId() methods
  // and a read-only CustomerOrder.getCustomer() method
  CustomerOrder{customer} to Customer
}
```

### Nested Entities

When working with large object graphs, it's often more expressive to nest entities directly on fields rather than defining them separately.

Nested entities are supported for entities, inputs, outputs, and events.

The following two mappings are equivalent:

<table markdown="1" width="100%">
<tr valign="top">
    <td>
```zdl
entity Customer {
    name String required
    address Address[] {
        street String required
        city String required
        country String required
    }
}
```
    </td>
    <td valign="middle">-></td>
    <td>
```zdl
entity Customer {
    name String required
    address Address[]
}

@embedded
entity Address {
    street String required
    city String required
    country String required
}
```
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

NOTE: For entities, the generated code depends on the persistence technology used:
- MongoDB generates nested objects, while
- JPA generates embedded entities with all columns in the same table. Nested arrays are not supported in JPA.

## Enums

Enums are compatible with [JDL enums](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/enums) with some differences:
- Enum keys are not required to be uppercase
- Enum values can only be numbers

```
enum <enum name> {
  <ENUM KEY> [(<enum value>)]
}
```

## Aggregate Objects

Aggregate object combines entities, command handlers and domain events for rich domain aggregates.

They look very similar to `services`, and for simple use cases you can use `services` and an entity annotated `@aggregate` as the aggregate root.

```
[<aggregate javadoc>]
[<aggregate annotation>*]
aggregate <aggregate name> (<aggregate root entity>) {

  [<command javadoc>]
  [<command annotation>*]
  <command name>([<CommandInput>]) [withEvents <DomainEvent>*]
}
```

ZDL Example:

```zdl
aggregate DeliveryAggregate (Delivery) {

    createDelivery(DeliveryInput) withEvents DeliveryStatusUpdated

    onOrderStatusUpdated(OrderStatusUpdated) withEvents DeliveryStatusUpdated

    updateDeliveryStatus(DeliveryStatusInput) withEvents DeliveryStatusUpdated

}
```

## Services and Commands

Services and commands are used to describe the operations, beyond CRUD, that can be performed on your domain aggregates.

Services follow this structure:

```
[<service javadoc>]
[<service annotation>*]
service <service name> for (<aggregate>[,<aggregate>]*)] {
  [<command javadoc>]
  [<command annotation>*]
  <command name>([<id>], [<CommandInput>]) [<CommandOutput>] [withEvents <DomainEvent>*]
}
```

### Service Commands

Service commands are transactional units of work that perform operations on aggregate entities.

They represent the functionality of your inner hexagon and should connect to the outside world through APIs, Adapters, and Mappers. Commands can be documented with annotations (like `@rest` or `@asyncapi`) that indicate which adapters will expose them. The SDK interprets these annotations for code generation, but they should not be confused with actual public APIs.

Some SDK plugins can generate draft OpenAPI and AsyncAPI definitions from these annotations, but the final API specifications (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI) should be considered the source of truth.

Service commands resemble Java methods but have important differences. They support only two parameter types:

- **`id`** - Indicates the command operates on a specific aggregate entity instance
- **`CommandInput`** - Points to an `entity` or `input` type containing the command data

**Command Output:**
- Can be any `entity` or `output` type, or omitted entirely
- If an entity type, indicates the entity will be created or updated
- Can be marked optional with `?` if the command may not return output

**Events:**
- Use `withEvents` to specify domain events published after command execution

```zdl
/**
* Service for Order Attachments.
*/
@rest("/order-attachments")
service AttachmentService for (CustomerOrder) {

  @post
  uploadFile(id, AttachmentFileInput) CustomerOrder? withEvents [AttachmentFileUploaded|AttachmentFileUploadFailed]

  @get("/{orderId}")
  listAttachmentFiles(id) AttachmentFileOutput[]

  @get("/{orderId}/{attachmentFileId}")
  downloadAttachmentFile(AttachmentFileId) AttachmentFileOutput
}

entity CustomerOrder {}
input AttachmentFileInput {}
output AttachmentFileOutput {}
```

### Service CRUD Commands

Service methods matching a CRUD pattern are treated as special by the SDK and an according CRUD implementation would be generated:

```zdl
service CustomerService for (Customer) {
    createCustomer(CustomerOrCustomerInput) Customer?
    updateCustomer(id, CustomerOrCustomerInput) Customer?
    getCustomer(id) Customer?
    listCustomers() Customer[]
    deleteCustomer(id)
}
```

CRUD commands may emit any domain events.

Command parameter type can be an aggregate entity or an input type. In some cases, and depending on configured settings, ZenWave SDK may generate input dtos even if entity types are used, following hexagonal/clean/onion architecture principles.

### Business Policies

Policies documents business decisions and rules. They can be associated with a particular aggregate and then referenced with the `@policy(policy_code)` annotation.

```zdl
policies (Customer) {
  policy001 "Describe here the content of this business rule"
}

service CustomerService for (Customer) {
    @policy(policy001)
    createCustomer(Customer) Customer withEvents CustomerUpdated
}
```

### Inputs

Inputs follow the same structure as entities, but they are not persistent. They belong to the outer ring/hexagon of your application, along with the Mappers. They are used to pass data to service commands.

They can reference other entities and enums but not they other way around. They also support [nested entities](#nested-entities).

```zdl
input AttachmentFileInput {
  name String required
  file Blob required
  mimetype AttachmentFileType required
}
```

### Outputs

Outputs follow the same structure as entities, but they are not persistent. They belong to the outer ring/hexagon of your application, along with the Mappers. They are used to pass data to service commands.

They can reference other entities, inputs and enums but not they other way around. They also support [nested entities](#nested-entities).

```zdl
input AttachmentFileOutput {
  customerOrderId Integer required
  name String required
  file Blob required
  mimetype AttachmentFileType required
}
```

## Domain Events

Domain events are used to describe the events that are published by your domain aggregates.

```
[<event javadoc>]
[<event annotation>*]
event <event name> [(<channel name>)] {
  [<field javadoc>]
  [<field annotation>*]
  <field name> <field type> [<validation>*] [<field suffix javadoc>] [,]
}
```

## Configuration Section

SDK plugin options can be configured in the `config` section.

This config options are inherited by all the SDK plugins, but each plugin can also define its own options.

```zdl
config {
  basePackage "com.example.myapp"
  persistence mongodb
}
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: `config` and `apis` sections should be at the top of the file, before any other declaration and after `global javadoc`.

### SDK Plugins

Plugins configured in the config section can be executed directly from ZenWave Editor (IntelliJ IDEA).

In addition to their own configuration, they will inherit the following options:

- `zdlFile` pointing to the current file,
- `targetFolder` to the project folder (not the file folder)
- and all configuration from `config` section.

## APIs Section

APIs are used to document APIs exposed by your application (provider) or Third Party APIs consumed by you (client).

Use it to document the API `uri` along with any other field/value that you want to include. It also supports javadoc comments.

```
apis {
    <api type>([provider|client]) <api name> {
        uri <api uri>
        (<field> <value>)*
    }
}
```

Example:

```zdl
apis {
    asyncapi(provider) MyEventsApi {
        uri "src/main/resources/asyncapi.yml"
    }
    openapi(provider) MyRestApi {
        uri "src/main/resources/openapi.yml"
    }
    asyncapi(client) ThirdPartyEventsApi {
        uri "https://.../asyncapi.yml"
    }
    openapi(client) ThirdPartyRestApi {
        uri "https://.../openapi.yml"
    }
}
```
