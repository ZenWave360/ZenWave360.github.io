# Getting Started with ZenWave 360Âº

## Installation

We recommend using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to install ZenWave SDK requirements: [Java 17+](https://sdkman.io/jdks), [Maven](https://sdkman.io/sdks#maven) and [JBang](https://sdkman.io/sdks#jbang).

NOTE: Temurin (Eclipse) is a good option for Java JDK as it is high performance, enterprise-caliber and open-sourced licensed.

## ZenWave SDK Installation

Use JBang to install an _evergreen_ self updating CLI for the ZenWave SDK.

```bash
jbang alias add --force --fresh --name=zw release@zenwave360/zenwave-sdk
```
**NOTE:** You can install ZenWave versions from different channel: `release` for latest stable version, `snapshots` for development versions. They can be installed side by side (using different `--name=<alias>`) or independently.

## Install ZenWave Editor IntelliJ Plugin

Install ZenWave Editor IntelliJ Plugin from JetBrains Marketplace:

For rendering class diagrams in markdown preview, install [PlantUML Integration](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration) plugin.

**NOTE:** ZenWave Editor will use `jbang zw` command to execute plugins. So you need JBang available in the PATH of the console configured by default in IntelliJ.

## Spring-Boot base Project

ZenWave SDK only generates business logic code and tests. It is expected to work with any compatible Spring-Boot project. Default backend generator is based ona maven single module project.

We expect most companies and teams to have their own starter base project. If you don't have one you can create one from https://start.spring.io or clone one of the ZenWave 360 base projects from our GitHub playground repository.

- ZenWave [Starter Project for JPA](https://github.com/ZenWave360/zenwave-playground/tree/main/zenwave-jpa-baseline)
- ZenWave [Starter Project for MongoDB](https://github.com/ZenWave360/zenwave-playground/tree/main/zenwave-mongodb-baseline)

NOTE: These baseline projects come with OpenAPI Generator and ZenWave SDK Maven plugins already configured, so you don't have to.

ZenWave SDK generated code was tested with Spring-Boot up to 3.5.0, Hibernate 6.x, MongoDB 5 and Spring-Cloud 2024.0.0, but because it only generates business code without any exotic dependency it should work with any compatible version.

Once you have installed ZenWave SDK CLI and IntelliJ Plugin you are ready to start modeling your domain and generating code.

## Examples & Tutorials

You can chek out [DDD Examples](/docs/examples/ddd-examples/) and [EDA Examples](/docs/examples/eda-examples/) in particular this ðŸ’¡[Customer Address JPA Service](/docs/examples/ddd-examples/customer-address-jpa/)ðŸ’¡ a canonical ZenWave example of a DDD Aggregate with JPA persistence and Externalized Domain Events. It will provide you a complete explanation of how to use ZenWave ZDL + SDK and what generated code looks like and what you can expect from it.

You can also follow this tutorial for a dive into ZenWave Modeling and Code Generation: [DDD In Practice: From Ubiquitous Language DSL to Complete Spring-Boot Kotlin Project](/posts/DDD-In-Practice_From_DSL_to_Complete_Spring-Boot_Kotlin/)


## ZDL Modeling and Code Generation

Scroll left/right for a quick overview of how ZDL modeling looks like, with an example. And then follow the instructions below.

            <Image src={zdlConfig} />
        </Slide>

        </Slide>
        <Slide index={3}>
            <h3><ButtonBack>ðŸ‘ˆ</ButtonBack> ðŸ‘‡ ZDL Service (with @annotations for REST API) <ButtonNext>ðŸ‘‰</ButtonNext></h3>
            <Image src={zdlService} />
        </Slide>
        <Slide index={4}>
            <h3><ButtonBack>ðŸ‘ˆ</ButtonBack> ðŸ‘‡ ZDL Events (with @annotations for AsyncAPI)</h3>
            <Image src={zdlEvents} />
        </Slide>
    </Slider>
    <ButtonBack>ðŸ‘ˆ</ButtonBack><ButtonNext>ðŸ‘‰</ButtonNext>
</CarouselProvider>


Create a new ZDL model or use one of ZDL examples as base:

1. Create a new file with `.zdl` extension
2. Model your Bounded Context adding some entities, services, inputs and events...
3. Add ZenWave SDK Plugins to ZDL `config` section. You can use IntelliJ live templates provided for this task.
4. Follow these steps to generate code and tests from your model:
    1. Generate API definitions from your model: OpenAPI and AsyncAPI v2/v3 are supported.
    2. Customize your API definitions. They are the source of truth for outbound/inbound communications.
    3. Configure API-First generators in `pom.xml` for OpenAPI and AsyncAPI.
    4. Generate your Core Backed code and tests. ZenWave SDK can generate CRUD implementation for your services.
    5. Customize generated code implementing non-CRUD service commands and customize generated tests.
    6. Implement Adapters code (web, event) connecting API-First generated code with your Core Backend. ZenWave SDK can generate Stub implementation for some adapters.
5. Run your tests and start your application.
