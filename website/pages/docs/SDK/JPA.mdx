# Backend Application with JPA
Modeling your JPA entities following DDD Aggregates principles.

ZenWave favors modeling JPA relationships following DDD Aggregate principles.

So in this DDD context, preferred relationships are: `OneToMany` and `OneToOne` from the aggregate root to each dependent, but you can still use `ManyToOne` and `ManyToMany` to suit your specific needs.

ZenWave also supports describing relationships between aggregates using `ManyToXXX` where an aggregate root references another aggregate root, yet those relationships will be mapped by *by-id* and providing a read-only and lazy-loading reference to the entity. This improves expressiveness and still following DDD principles. Checkout [Relationships Between Aggregates](#relationships-between-aggregates) section for more details.

## Mapping Relationships


### OneToMany

Letâ€™s start with a classic OneToMany relationship: an Owner and a Car. An owner can have many cars, and a car can have only one owner.

You can map it bidirectionally with the following code:

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Owner { }

entity Car { }

relationship OneToMany {
  Owner{cars} to Car{owner}
}
```

Or unidirectional as:

```zdl
relationship OneToMany {
  Owner{cars} to Car
}
```

### OneToOne

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer { }

entity Address { }

relationship OneToOne {
    Customer{address} to Address{customer}
}
```

Will result in the following JPA mapping:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "customer")
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    //...
	@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
	@JoinColumn(unique = true)
	private Address address;
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "address")
public class Address implements Serializable {
    //...
	@OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
	private Customer customer;
}
```

### OneToOne between Aggregates

If your use a `OneToOne` relationship between aggregates, ZenWave will map it by id, with a read-only reference to the entity.

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer { }
@aggregate
entity Address { }

relationship OneToOne {
    Customer{address} to Address{customer}
}
```

Will result in the following JPA mapping:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "customer")
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    //...
	@Column(name = "address_id")
	private Long addressId;

	@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
	@JoinColumn(unique = true)
	private Address address;
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "address")
public class Address implements Serializable {
    //...
	@OneToOne(mappedBy = "address", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
	private Customer customer;
}
```

See [Relationships Between Aggregates](#relationships-between-aggregates) section for more details.

### @MapsId with OneToOne

You can use JPA Derived Identifiers (`@MapsId`) for one-to-one relationship

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer { }

entity Address { }

relationship OneToOne {
    Customer{address required} to @Id Address{customer}
}
```

Will result in the following JPA mapping:

```java
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
	@NotNull
	@MapsId
	@JoinColumn(name = "id")
	private Address address;
}

public class Address implements Serializable {
	@OneToOne(mappedBy = "address", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
	private Customer customer;
}
```


### ManyToOne

If your use an unidirectional `ManyToOne` relationship from an aggregate to another aggregate root, ZenWave will map it by id, with a read-only reference to the entity.

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer { }
@aggregate
entity Address { }

relationship ManyToOne {
    Address{customer} to Customer
}
```

Will result in the following JPA mapping:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "address")
public class Address implements Serializable {
    //...
	@Column(name = "customer_id")
	private Long customerId;

	@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
	@JoinColumn(name = "customer_id", updatable = false, insertable = false)
	private Customer customer;

}
```

See [Relationships Between Aggregates](#relationships-between-aggregates) section for more details.

### ManyToMany

ManyToMany relationships are not very common in DDD, but you can still use ZenWave ZDL to model them and get your JPA entities generated.

```zdl
entity Driver {}
entity Car {}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Car{driver} to Driver{car}
}
```

## Relationships Between Aggregates

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), because an aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that should be treated as a single unit. Relationships between aggregates are be mapped by their IDs rather than direct object references.

```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer {
}

@aggregate
entity Address {
  customerId Long
}
```

This helps to maintain consistency and integrity of the data within the aggregate but is way less expressive because in terms of modelling.

ZenWave SDK allows you to define `@ManyToNNN` relationships between aggregates, which are then mapped by their IDs this an extra a read-only and lazy-loading reference to the entity.


```zdl
@aggregate
entity Customer { }

@aggregate
entity Address { }

relationship ManyToOne {
    // ManyToNNN relationships between @aggregates are mapped by id, with a read-only reference to the entity
    Address{customer} to Customer
}
```

The above ZDL model will generate the following JPA mapping:

```java
@Table(name = "address")
public class Address implements Serializable {

    // ...

    @Column(name = "customer_id") // Mapped by id
    private Long customerId;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY) // Read-only reference to the entity
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id", updatable = false, insertable = false)
    private Customer customer;
}
```

And an `IntegrationTest` to validate your Aggregates relationships are working as expected:

```java
public class AddressRepositoryIntegrationTest extends BaseRepositoryIntegrationTest {

	@Test
	public void saveTest() {
		Address address = new Address();
		address.setStreet("");
		address.setCity("");
		address.setState("");
		address.setZip("");
		address.setType(AddressType.values()[0]);

		// ManyToOne customer. owner: true
		var customerId = 1L;
		address.setCustomerId(customerId); // using id to write relationship

		// Persist aggregate root
		var created = addressRepository.save(address);

		entityManager.refresh(created); // reloading to get relationships persisted by id
		Assertions.assertTrue(created.getId() != null);
		Assertions.assertTrue(created.getVersion() != null);

        // loading and validating relationship
		Assertions.assertTrue(address.getCustomer().getId() == customerId);
	}
}
```
