> ðŸ‘‰ ZenWave360 Helps You Create Software Easy to Understand

Being easy to understand should be the gold standard of good and maintainable software.

<strong className="orange">ZenWave 360Âº</strong> is a set of tools built on the foundations of <strong className="orange">Domain Driven Design</strong> and <strong className="orange">API-First</strong> principles for <strong className="orange">Event-Driven Architectures.</strong>

## Domain Driven Design and API-First for Event Driven Microservices

<Quote>The domain model is a powerful communication tool. It provides a shared vision of the structure and behavior of the system.</Quote>

<strong className="orange">Event-Driven Architecture</strong> reflects how we conduct business in real life - asynchronously and in response to events. That is why it is gaining popularity as the go-to architectural pattern for building enterprise applications.

Our lives and businesses are a continuous sequence of events. We are perpetually responding to these events and initiating new ones. <strong className="orange">This is a reflection of how we operate in the real world</strong>. Therefore, Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) are ideally suited for creating software that accurately represents and empowers our business processes.

<strong className="orange">Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</strong> is a software development approach that emphasizes the importance of understanding the business domain in order to create effective software. Design, in the DDD sense, <strong className="orange">is really about understanding</strong>, not inventing. Focusing on creating software that matches the mental model of the problem domain.

With a <strong className="orange">good understanding of the business</strong> process we want to model even the <strong className="orange">simplest architectural pattern</strong> suffices for crafting software that's straightforward and maintainable.

On the other hand with a <strong className="orange">poor understanding</strong> of the business process we want to model, there is <strong className="orange">no amount of clean code</strong>, clean architecture, SOLID principles, hexagonal, event-driven... that will make your code easy to maintain and to evolve because with a poor understanding, new requirements will spring as a surprise shaking the foundations of your previous design.

## ZDL Domain Model Language as 'Ubiquitous Language' format

[ZDL](/docs/event-driven-design/zenwave-domain-language) is a developer friendly domain model format, that can map the discoveries of [Event-Storming](/docs/event-driven-design/event-storming) workshops capturing the essence of Event-Driven Domains while maintaining the business language brought up during Event-Storming sessions.

<strong className="orange">ZDL Domain Model Language is</strong>

- <strong className="orange">Developer Friendly</strong>: compact and concise format resembling a very lightweight programing language.
- Retaining the <strong className="orange">Business Language</strong> discovered during Event-Storming sessions
- And because it's also <strong className="orange">Machine Friendly</strong> it can be converted into multiple software artifacts <strong className="orange">propagating that Common/Ubiquitous Language</strong> automatically and effortless.

Efectively closing the Gap between Domain Experts, Technical Experts and Working Software & Tests

## ZenWave SDK Accelerates your Development Cycle

<Quote>Code is not the center, but merely one expression of the model.</Quote>

Because the most effective way to model is to do so in the context of a running system that can demonstrate whether the model actually works. ZenWave SDK helps you convert your Domain Models into working Software & Tests.

[ZenWave SDK](/docs/zenwave-sdk) accelerates your development cycle by converting your Domain Models into well crafted software artifacts you can assemble into a running application.

With ZenWave SDK you can quickly convert your models into working software:
- API definitions: OpenAPI and AsyncAPI v2/v3
- Multiple backend implementations with Spring-Boot and Spring-Cloud: with JPA and MongoDB flavors.
- SpringMVC RestControllers from OpenAPI + ZDL: complete controller skeletons with their mapstruct mappers, connecting the inside of your backend with the external world through your APIs.
- API-First code generator for AsyncAPI v2/v3 for producing and consuming async events.
- API-Testing with Spring WebTestClient and KarateDSL.

ZenWave SDK main purpose is to help you produce successful software projects by dramatically shortening the feedback loop between the expert domain knowledge and working software and its tests.

<Image alt="Domain Driven Design Feedback Loop" dark={dddFeedbackLoopDark} light={dddFeedbackLoopLight}/>

In this way all team members: **Domain Experts**, **Product Owners**, **Software Architects**, **Developers** and **Testers** can provide early feedback based on an **Ubiquitous Language (ZDL)** and the software and tests generated from that model.

# Business Domain Modeling

<Quote>
  A good model is a foundation that can accommodate change in the direction and perspective of business experts.
</Quote>


ZenWave 360Âº Business Domain Modeling is sustained in three pillars:

- <strong className="orange">Understand the Mental Model</strong> of the Business Experts.
- Use <strong className="orange">ZDL Model Language</strong> to create and Ubiquitous Language that reflects the mental model of the Business Experts.
- Use <strong className="orange">ZenWave SDK</strong> to convert the ZDL Model <strong className="orange">into different Software Artifacts</strong>.

## Understand the mental model of the business experts

This approach emphasizes <strong className="orange">the importance of understanding the business domain</strong> in order to create effective software.

The first step is to understand the mental model of the business experts because <strong className="orange">all requirements and assumptions will come from this mental model</strong>. Embedding the perspective of domain experts into your model is by far the most important aspect to create good maintainable software.

If we don't get right the mental model of business experts, no amount of <strong className="orange">Clean Code</strong>, <strong className="orange">Clean Architecture</strong>, <strong className="orange">Hexagonal Architecture</strong>, etc... will help in creating good and maintainable software.

<strong className="orange">Event-Storming</strong> is the method we employ to grasp the mental model of business experts. Because it's technological low entry barrier, and because is a <strong className="orange">perfect fit for modeling Event-Driven Architectures</strong>.


## Create and Ubiquitous Language to reflect the mental model of the Business Experts

<Quote>
  It is not the domain expertsâ€™ knowledge that goes to production, it is the assumption of the developers.
  <QuoteAuthor>- Alberto Brandolini</QuoteAuthor>
</Quote>

The goal of Ubiquitous Language is to create a common language that reduces misunderstandings and improves communication between technical and non-technical team members.

- <strong className="orange">Shared and Common</strong>: The language is shared by all team members, including developers, domain experts, and stakeholders. It's used in all forms of communication, from meetings and emails to code and documentation.
- <strong className="orange">Model-Based</strong>: The language is based on the domain model. It reflects the structures and relationships in the model.
- <strong className="orange">Explicit</strong>: The language is explicit, meaning that each term has a specific and clear definition. This reduces ambiguity and misunderstanding.
- <strong className="orange">Used in Code</strong>: The language is used in the codebase. Class names, method names, variable names, etc., should all be based on the Ubiquitous Language.

ZenWave <strong className="orange">ZDL Modeling Language</strong> is a Domain Specific Language that allows you to create a Conceptual Model that reflects the mental model of the business experts following DDD and Event-Driven Architecture principles.

It can <strong className="orange">map the discoveries of an Event-Storming session</strong>, retaining the language of business experts. It's <strong className="orange">designed to be developer friendly</strong>, and because it can be <strong className="orange">converted into different software artifacts</strong>, it will propagate that Common Language to code, tests, api definitions...

-> As a technical expert you can use this ZDL Modeling Language to communicate within your team, and narrate the story expressed by the model back to domain experts in their own language.

## Convert the Ubiquitous Language into different Software Artifacts with ZenWave SDK

<Quote>
  The best way to validate a conceptual model is to implement it.
</Quote>

<strong className="orange">Working software</strong> is the best way to evaluate the validity of a conceptual model. It allows for <strong className="orange">early feedback</strong> from all members of the development team, including developers, testers, and others, which can be crucial for the iterative refinement of the model.

ZenWave SDK is <strong className="orange">a set of tools</strong> that allows you to <strong className="orange">convert the Ubiquitous Language</strong> into different software artifacts, like:

- <strong className="orange">API Definitions:</strong> AsyncAPI v2/v3, OpenAPI...
- <strong className="orange">Drawings and Documentation:</strong> PlantUML, Mermaid, Markdown...
- <strong className="orange">Multiple Backend Implementations</strong> for Spring-Boot, Spring-Cloud, JPA, MongoDB...
- <strong className="orange">API-First Code</strong> for AsyncAPI and OpenAPI
- <strong className="orange">API-Testing...</strong>

<strong className="orange">Automatically propagating the Ubiquitous Language across code</strong> and providing the building blocks to put together a working implementation of your domain in no time.
